## Using the provider

If you are using Terraform 0.13, you can install the provider directly from the 
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kvrhdn/honeycombio/latest). To use the provider with 
Terraform 0.12 you'll have to install the provider manually.

### Terraform 0.13

Add the following block in your Terraform config. For more information, refer to 
[Automatic installation of third-party providers](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/guide-v0.13-beta/provider-sources#terraform-v013-beta-automatic-installation-of-third-party-providers). 
This will download the provider from the Terraform Registry:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    honeycombio = {
      source  = "kvrhdn/honeycombio"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Terraform 0.12

To use this provider with Terraform 0.12, you will need to download and install the executable yourself. You can 
download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/kvrhdn/terraform-provider-honeycombio/releases) 
or build it directly from source:

```sh
# clone the repository and run:
go build -o terraform-provider-honeycombio
```

Once you have the executable, you can either place it in your working directory (the directory you run `terraform init`) 
or [install it is a third-party plugin](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins):

```sh
# for Linux and macOS
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
cp terraform-provider-honeycombio ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
```
