# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, whether they are technical in nature or not.

Feel free to open a new issue to ask questions, discuss bugs, or propose enhancements.

You can also chat with us on the **Honeycomb Pollinators** Slack in the **#discuss-api-and-terraform** channel.

The rest of this document describes how to get started developing on this repository.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Relevant documentation

Hashicorp has a lot of documentation on creating Terraform providers categorized under [Plugin Development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin).
This might help when getting started, but are not a pre-requisite to contribute.
Feel free to just open an issue and we can guide you along the way.

## Contributing changes

As there are currently no Honeycomb SDKs, this repository contains an embedded API Client for the [Honeycomb API](https://docs.honeycomb.io/api)
in the `client/` directory in the root of the repository.

The provider currently has a mix of the older [Plugin SDKv2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2)
and newer [Plugin Framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework) resources and data sources.
Any new additions should be built with the Plugin Framework.

 * The Plugin SDK-based code is contained in the `honeycombio/` directory in the root of the repository.
 * The Plugin Framework-based code is contained in the `internal/provider` directory.

Any PRs reimplmenting Plugin SDKv2 resources or datasources in the Plugin Framework with be enthusiastically accepted. üôè

### Preview document changes

Hashicorp has a tool to preview documentation.
Visit [registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview).

### Running the tests

Most of the tests are live integration tests against the [Honeycomb API](https://docs.honeycomb.io/api).
To run the tests you'll need to have access to a Honeycomb account and both a [Configuration Key](https://docs.honeycomb.io/get-started/best-practices/api-keys/#configuration-keys)
and a [Management Key](https://docs.honeycomb.io/get-started/best-practices/api-keys/#management-keys) with all permissions and scopes granted.

Some tests, such as those for SLOs and those for the Query Data API require access to a Pro or Enterprise team.

Additionally, tests for Slack recipients requires that the Slack authorization be [set up with the team ahead of time](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/triggers/#slack)

Next, some of the embedded client tests require that you **initialize the dataset**.
The helper script [setup-testsuite-dataset](scripts/setup-testsuite-dataset) will create the dataset and required columns that are used in the tests. 
You will need to use Bash 4+ to run this script.

```sh
HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=<your API key> HONEYCOMB_DATASET=<dataset> ./scripts/setup-testsuite-dataset
```

Finally, **run the full testsuite**!
There is a `.env` file checked into the root of the repository which can be used to store the relevant environment variables required for the tests:

- `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`: a Configuration Key for a Honeycomb Team
- `HONEYCOMB_DATASET`: name of the test dataset to run tests against
- `HONEYCOMB_KEY_ID` and `HONEYCOMB_KEY_SECRET`: the v2 Management API Key pair for a Honeycomb Team

Or alternatively, you can set them directly and run the `testacc` make target:

```sh
HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=<CONFIGURATION KEY> HONEYCOMB_KEY_ID=<MGMT KEY ID> HONEYCOMB_KEY_SECRET=<MGMT KEY SECRET> HONEYCOMB_DATASET=<dataset> make testacc
```

### Using a locally built version of the provider

It can be handy to run terraform with a local version of the provider during development.

The best way to do this is with a [Development Override](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers).
There is already a `.terraformrc.local` file checked into the root of the repository which may be a helpful starting point.

### Enabling log output

To print logs (including full dumps of requests and their responses), you have to set `TF_LOG` to at least `debug` when running Terraform:

A handy one-liner to simultaneously write the output to a file:

```sh
TF_LOG=debug terraform apply 2>&1 | tee output.log
```

For more information, see [Debugging Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/debugging).

### Lints and Style

This project uses `golangci-lint` with the configuration at `.golangci.yml` in the root of the repository.

### Run GitHub Actions on your fork

If you fork the repository, you can also run the tests on GitHub Actions (for free since it's a public repository). Unfortunatly there is no mechanism to share secrets, so all runs will fail until the necessary secrets are configured.

To properly setup the GitHub Actions, add the following secrets:

- `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY`: a Configuration Key for a Honeycomb Team
- `HONEYCOMB_DATASET`: name of the test dataset to run tests against
- `HONEYCOMB_KEY_ID` and `HONEYCOMB_KEY_SECRET`: the v2 Management API Key pair for a Honeycomb Team

## Release procedure

To release a new version of the Terraform provider a binary has to be built for a list of platforms ([more information](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/publishing#creating-a-github-release)).
This process is largely automated with GoReleaser and GitHub Actions.

The unautomated part is creating a "releast commit" which updates `CHANGELOG.md` in the root of the repository as well as the references to the build version in the various examples.

Once the release commit has landed on the `main` branch:

- Create a tag following semantic convention prefixed with a `v` (i.e. `v0.83.0`)
  - this will start the "release" workflow which builds various versions of the provider for target platforms and architectures.
    This can take up to 10 minutes to complete.
- When the release workflow compltes, go to [releases](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-provider-honeycombio/releases/) and you'll find a draft release with the build artifacts attached.
- Update the release name to match the release tag (i.e. `v0.83.0`)
- Copy the section from `CHANGELOG.md` for this release into the release description.
- Publish the release.
- Within a few minutes, the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/honeycombio/honeycombio/latest) should have picked up and published the new version.
