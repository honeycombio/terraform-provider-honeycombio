# 0.38.0 (Aug 15, 2025)

NOTES:

* This release introduces provider-level Feature Toggles which were heavily influenced by the Azure Provider.

# 0.36.0 (Jun 6, 2025)

NOTES: this release contains support for tagging Flexible Boards, however at the time of release the Honeycomb UI is still missing tagging support for Boards.
This was done to allow users to begin tag all three of the initial resources supporting tags (SLOs, Triggers, Boards).

HOUSEKEEPING:

# 0.33.0 (Apr 24, 2025)

NOTES: this release contains support for [Dynamic Baseline Triggers](https://docs.honeycomb.io/notify/alert/triggers/create/#trigger-alert-type).

* maint(deps): bump golang.org/x/net from 0.38.0 to 0.39.0 (#657)

# 0.32.0 (Apr 7, 2025)

NOTES: this release contains support for [Multi-Dataset SLOs and Burn Alerts](https://docs.honeycomb.io/notify/alert/slos/#multiple-services-on-slos)!
  In addition, the `dataset` argument has become optional for resources that are Environment aware, which means using the magic `__all__` string is no longer required.
  In order to allow cleaner configurations and avoid destructive recreation, removing `dataset = "__all__"` from a resource does not force re-creation as the lack of `dataset` argument is treated as equivalent.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* feat(r/slo, d/slo): multi-dataset support (#635, #641)
* feat(r/burn_alert): multi-dataset support (#644)
* feat(d/query_specification): 'order' validation support (#642)

# 0.27.0 (Aug 23, 2024)

NOTES:

**This release contains breaking and behavioral changes**

* `r/dataset`: will now attempt to *delete* datasets on destroy.
  However, they come with delete protection (`delete_protection`) enabled by default and it must be disabled for the destroy to succeed.
  This behavior matches `r/environment` as introduced in v0.25.0
* `r/dataset`: will now error on create if a Dataset with that name already exists in the Environment.
  Previously, the dataset would be silently imported into state, but given deletion is now possible on destroy this behavior has to changed to be more standard.
  The end-user can choose to either adjust the name or import the existing Dataset.
* client: if the Datasets API returns an HTTP '200 OK' -- as opposed to '201 Created' -- on create the `Datasets.Create` method will now return `ErrDatasetExists`.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* *New Data Source*: `honeycombio_dataset` (#535)
* feat: ends/does-not-end-with filters (#530)
* feat: add P20 and P80 calculations (#534)
* feat: full lifecycle support for datasets (#535)

BUGFIXES:

* chore(r/query): improve doc for derived_column (#531)

HOUSEKEEPING:

* chore: address new linter errors (#532)

# 0.26.0 (Aug 12, 2024)

NOTES:

This release deprecates `r/msteams_recipient` in favor of the new `r/msteams_workflow_recipient` in line with Microsoft's deprecation of O365 Connectors.
New instances of `r/msteams_recipient` can no longer be created and we recommend you migrate your integration to the Workflow-based solution as soon as possible.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* feat(client): V2 API client ratelimit improvements (#519)
* chore(r/query): add doc note about using latest derived column definition (#521)
* r/msteams_workflow_recipient: new resource for managing MS Teams Workflow integrations (#524)

# 0.25.0 (Jul 25, 2024)

NOTES:

This release includes new resources for managing your team's Environments and
Ingest API Keys. These resources operate against new team-level APIs, which
require a new team-level Management API Key for authentication. See the [new
setup instructions for "v2 APIs"](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-provider-honeycombio/blob/main/README.md#v2-apis) in the README.

[Best Practices for API Keys](https://docs.honeycomb.io/get-started/best-practices/api-keys/) has more information on the types of API keys and when to use them.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* r/api_key: new resource for managing Ingest API Keys (#496)
* r/environment: new resource for managing Environments (#501)

BUGFIXES:
* fix: Reflect OpenAPI validation of SLOs (#506)
* fix: client - guard against nil resp during retry check (#491)

* chore: cleanup static environment ID in favour of new functionality (#502)
* chore: refresh README and CONTRIBUTING docs (#503)

# 0.24.0 (Jun 14, 2024)

NOTES:

* This release includes support for placing SLOs on Boards: a feature under active development.
SLO placement on Boards does not yet support a custom order and instead are placed by creation date.
Ordered placement is a roadmap item for the feature and when that lands there will be a subsequent provider update.
* This release re-introduces the `query_json` attribute on `r/trigger` enabling validation that a query meets the restrictions for use by a Trigger.
This was a poor development experience and the hope is that the slight deviation from other resource construction provides a better experience -- especially for those using the provider in CI systems like HCP Terraform, Atlantis, et cetera.
Triggers require one of `query_json` or `query_id`, but the recommendation going forward will be to use `query_json`.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* r/query: clean up generated queryspec output (#469)
* r/board: add SLO support (#485)
* r/trigger: re-introduce query_json for deeper validation (#487)

# 0.21.0 (Jan 26, 2024)

NOTES:

* If you are a downstream consumer of the `client` package in another Go project, this release contains a breaking change:
`client.NewClient` now takes no arguments and creates a client with the default configuration
values, while `client.NewClientWithConfig` has been added to allow passing a custom configuration.
  * This does not effect Terraform Configurations: only projects importing the `client` Package.
* If you were making use of the previously undocumented `HONEYCOMB_API_HOST` environment variable to override the Honeycomb API URL,
it has been renamed to the more standard `HONEYCOMB_API_ENDPOINT`.

* feat(client): standardize and document API endpoint envvar (#414)

# 0.16.0 (Sep 6, 2023)

NOTES: this release includes a complete rewrite of the `honeycombio_burn_alert` resource: migrating it from the Terraform Plugin SDKv2 to the new Plugin Framework.
This was done to fix a number of long-standing bugs related to the `recipient` block similar to the work done in 0.15.0 for the `honeycombio_trigger` resource.

As with the `honeycombio_trigger` resource migration, this work has resulted in some subtle, but non-breaking side effects:

* after updating, the next "plan" will show all burn alert recipients being updated in-place
  * at the core of most all of these bugs was that fact that all of `id`, `type`, and `target` for a recipient were being stored in state.
  Now only `id` or the `type`+`target` pair will be stored in the state and the plan output should reflect this.
* enforcement of only specifying one of `id` or `type`+`target` is now possible due to the new flexibility gained by migrating to the Plugin Framework.
Due to the shape of the recipient blocks in the schema, this validation was not possible with the Plugin SDK.
  * in configurations specifying both `id` and `type`+`target` in recipient blocks, the suggestion is to just use `id` going forward.

FEATURES:

* *New Datasource*: `honeycombio_slo` (#345)
* *New Datasource*: `honeycombio_slos` (#345)
* *New Datasource*: `honeycombio_auth_metadata` (#353)

* the migration has introduced a new bug (#309) affecting only PagerDuty recipients where the default notification severity of `critical` was being relied upon without specifying a `notification_details` block.
  * we felt that the benefit of these fixes outweighted the impact of this newly introduced bug
  * the bug has a very straight forward work around (just specify the severity!), documented in the issue (#309)

FEATURES:

# 0.13.0 (Jan 18, 2023)

NOTES: The `honeycombio_column` resource will now *delete* dataset columns on destroy.

NOTES:
