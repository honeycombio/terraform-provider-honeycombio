# Resource: honeycombio_slo

Creates a service level objective (SLO). For more information about SLOs, check out [Set Service Level Objectives (SLOs)](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/slos/).

## Example Usage

### Single Dataset SLO

{{tffile "examples/resources/honeycombio_slo/single_dataset_slo.tf"}}

### Multi-Dataset SLO

{{tffile "examples/resources/honeycombio_slo/multi_dataset_slo.tf"}}

-> **Note** As [Derived Columns](derived_column.md) cannot be renamed or deleted while in use, it is recommended to use the [create_before_destroy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#create_before_destroy) lifecycle argument on your SLI resources as shown in the example above.
This way you will avoid running into conflicts if the Derived Column needs to be recreated.

~> **Note** `dataset` will be deprecated in a future release. One of `dataset` or `datasets` is required. In the meantime, you can swap `dataset` with a single value array for `datasets` to effectively evaluate to the same configuration.

## Import

Single-dataset SLOs can be imported using by using their ID combined with their dataset.
If the SLO is a multi-dataset (MD) SLO, the dataset is not provided.

### SLO

```
$ terraform import honeycombio_slo.my_slo my-dataset/bj9BwOb1uKz
```

### Multi-dataset SLO

```
$ terraform import honeycombio_slo.my_slo bj9BwOb1uKz
```

You can find the ID in the URL bar when visiting the SLO from the UI.
