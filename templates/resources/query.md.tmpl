# Resource: honeycombio_query

Creates a Query scoped to a Dataset or Environment.

Queries can be used by Triggers and Boards, or be executed via the [Query Data API](https://docs.honeycomb.io/api/query-results/).

-> Queries are immutable and can not be deleted -- only created or read.
  Any changes will result in a new query object being created.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/honeycombio_query/resource.tf"}}

-> **Note** If you are referencing a [Derived Column](derived_column.md) in your query and want to ensure you are always using the latest definition
  of the derived column you should use the [replace_triggered_by](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#replace_triggered_by)
  lifecycle argument as shown in the example above.
