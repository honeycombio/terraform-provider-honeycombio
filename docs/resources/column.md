# Resource: honeycombio_column

Provides a Honeycomb Column resource.
This can be used to create, update, and delete columns in a dataset.

~> **Warning** Deleting a column is a destructive and irreversible operation which also removes the data in the column.

-> Version 0.38 and later of the Honeycomb Provider include a Feature Toggle which allows the column to be imported and updated automatically if there is a conflict during create instead of throwing an error.
  This is potentially dangerous if the type changes on the update -- switching from `string` to `boolean` and causing dataloss, for example -- and should be used with caution.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

resource "honeycombio_column" "duration_ms" {
  name        = "duration_ms_log10"
  type        = "float"
  description = "Duration of the trace"

  dataset = var.dataset
}
```
