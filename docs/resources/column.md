# Resource: honeycombio_column

Provides a Honeycomb Column resource.
This can be used to create, update, and delete columns in a dataset.

-> **Note**: deleting a column is a destructive and irreversible operation which also removes the data in the column.

-> **Note**: prior to version 0.13.0 of the provider, columns were *not* deleted on destroy but left in place and only removed from state.

  type = string
}

resource "honeycombio_column" "duration_ms" {
  name        = "duration_ms_log10"

}
```
