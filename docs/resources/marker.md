# Resource: honeycombio_marker

Creates a marker. For more information about markers, check out [Annotate the timeline with Markers](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/customizing-your-query/markers/).

-> Destroying or replacing this resource will not delete the previously created marker.
This is intentional to preserve the markers.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

variable "app_version" {
  type = string
}

resource "honeycombio_marker" "app_deploy" {
  message = "deploy ${var.app_version}"
  type    = "deploy"
  url     = "http://www.example.com/"

  dataset = var.dataset
}
```
