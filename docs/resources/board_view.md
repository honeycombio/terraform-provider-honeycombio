# Resource: honeycombio_board_view

Manages a board view in a Honeycomb flexible board. Maximum of 50 boards views per board.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example

```terraform
variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

# Create a flexible board first
resource "honeycombio_flexible_board" "example" {
  name        = "Service Monitoring Board"
  description = "A board for monitoring service health"
}

# Create a board view with various filter types
resource "honeycombio_board_view" "production_errors" {
  board_id = honeycombio_flexible_board.example.id
  name     = "Production Errors"

  filter {
    column    = "service.name"
    operation = "exists"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "environment"
    operation = "="
    value     = "production"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "status_code"
    operation = ">="
    value     = "500"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "error_type"
    operation = "in"
    value     = "timeout,database_error,network_error"
  }
}

# Another board view example with different filters
resource "honeycombio_board_view" "high_latency" {
  board_id = honeycombio_flexible_board.example.id
  name     = "High Latency Requests"

  filter {
    column    = "trace.parent_id"
    operation = "does-not-exist"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "duration_ms"
    operation = ">"
    value     = "1000"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "service.name"
    operation = "not-in"
    value     = "health-check,metrics"
  }
}
```

### Comprehensive Example

```terraform
variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

# Create a flexible board
resource "honeycombio_flexible_board" "monitoring" {
  name        = "Application Monitoring"
  description = "Comprehensive monitoring dashboard"

  tags = {
    team    = "platform"
    project = "monitoring"
  }
}

# Board view for API errors
resource "honeycombio_board_view" "api_errors" {
  board_id = honeycombio_flexible_board.monitoring.id
  name     = "API Errors"

  filter {
    column    = "service.name"
    operation = "exists"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "http.status_code"
    operation = ">="
    value     = "400"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "environment"
    operation = "="
    value     = "production"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "error.message"
    operation = "contains"
    value     = "timeout"
  }
}

# Board view for specific services
resource "honeycombio_board_view" "core_services" {
  board_id = honeycombio_flexible_board.monitoring.id
  name     = "Core Services"

  filter {
    column    = "service.name"
    operation = "in"
    value     = "api-service,payment-service,user-service"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "duration_ms"
    operation = "<"
    value     = "500"
  }
}

# Board view for slow queries
resource "honeycombio_board_view" "slow_queries" {
  board_id = honeycombio_flexible_board.monitoring.id
  name     = "Slow Database Queries"

  filter {
    column    = "query.duration_ms"
    operation = ">"
    value     = "1000"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "database.name"
    operation = "exists"
  }

  filter {
    column    = "query.type"
    operation = "!="
    value     = "SELECT"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `board_id` (String) The ID of the flexible board this view belongs to.
- `name` (String) The name of the board view.

### Optional

- `filter` (Block List) List of filters to apply to the board view. **Required:** At least one filter must be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the board view.

<a id="nestedblock--filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `column` (String) The column to filter on.
- `operation` (String) The operator to apply. See the supported list at [Filter Operators](https://docs.honeycomb.io/api/query-specification/#filter-operators). Not all operators require a value.

Optional:

- `value` (String) The value used for the filter. Not needed if operation is "exists" or "does-not-exist". For "in" or "not-in" operations, provide a comma-separated list of values.
