# Resource: honeycombio_query_annotation

Creates a query annotation in a dataset.

-> **Note** A query annotation points to a specific query. Any change to the query will result in a new query ID and the annotation will no longer apply.
If you use the "honeycombio_query_specification" to determine the `query_id` parameter (as in the example below), Terraform will destroy the old query annotation and create a new one.
If this is wrong for your use case, please open an issue in [honeycombio/terraform-provider-honeycombio](https://github.com/honeycombio/terraform-provider-honeycombio).

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

data "honeycombio_query_specification" "test_query" {
  calculation {
    op     = "AVG"
    column = "duration_ms"
  }

  filter {
    column = "duration_ms"
    op     = ">"
    value  = 10
  }
}

resource "honeycombio_query" "test_query" {
  dataset    = var.dataset
  query_json = data.honeycombio_query_specification.test_query.json
}

resource "honeycombio_query_annotation" "test_annotation" {
	dataset     = var.dataset
	query_id    = honeycombio_query.test_query.id
	name        = "My Cool Query"
	description = "Describes my cool query (optional)"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `dataset` - (Required) The dataset this query annotation is added to. Use `__all__` for Environment-wide query annotations.
* `query_id` - (Required) The ID of the query that the annotation will be created on. Note that a query can have more than one annotation.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the query annotation that will display in the Honeycomb UI.
* `description` - (Optional) The description for the query annotation.

## Attribute Reference
