# Resource: honeycombio_dataset

Creates a Dataset in an Environment.

~> **Warning** Prior to version 0.27.0 of the provider, datasets were *not* deleted on destroy but left in place and only removed from state.

-> Version 0.38 and later of the Honeycomb Provider include a Feature Toggle which allows the dataset to be imported and updated automatically if there is a conflict during create instead of throwing an error.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "honeycombio_dataset" "my_dataset" {
  name        = "My dataset"
  description = "buzzing with data"
}
```
