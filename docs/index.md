```hcl
terraform {

    honeycombio = {
      source  = "honeycombio/honeycombio"
      version = "~> 0.8.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Honeycomb provider
provider "honeycombio" {
  # You can set the API key with the environment variable HONEYCOMB_API_KEY
}

variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

# Create a marker
resource "honeycombio_marker" "hello" {
  message = "Hello world!"

  dataset = var.dataset
}
```

## Authentication

The Honeycomb provider requires an API key to communicate with the Honeycomb API. API keys and their permissions can be managed in _Team settings_.

The key can be set with the `api_key` argument or via the `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` or `HONEYCOMBIO_APIKEY` environment variable.

`HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` environment variable will take priority over the `HONEYCOMBIO_APIKEY` environment variable.

~> **Note** Hard-coding API keys in any Terraform configuration is not recommended. Consider using the one of the  environment variable options.

## Argument Reference

* `api_key` - (Required) The Honeycomb API key to use. It can also be set using `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` or `HONEYCOMBIO_APIKEY` environment variables.
* `api_url` - (Optional) Override the url of the Honeycomb.io API. Defaults to `https://api.honeycomb.io`.
