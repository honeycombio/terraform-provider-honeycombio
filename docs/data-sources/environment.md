# Data Source: honeycombio_environment

The `honeycombio_environment` data source retrieves the details of a single Environment.

~> **Warning** Terraform will fail unless exactly one environment is returned by the search.
  Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a single environment only.
  If you want to retrieve multiple environments, use the `honeycombio_environments` data source instead.

-> This data source requires the provider be configured with a Management Key with `environments:read` in the configured scopes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Retrieve the details of an Environment
data "honeycombio_environment" "prod" {
  id = "hcaen_01j1d7t02zf7wgw7q89z3t60vf"
}
```

### Filter Example

```terraform
data "honeycombio_environment" "classic" {
  detail_filter {
    name  = "name"
    value = "Classic"
  }
}

data "honeycombio_environment" "prod" {
  detail_filter {
    name  = "name"
    value = "prod"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `detail_filter` (Block List) Attributes to filter the results with. Multiple `detail_filter` blocks can be provided, and all conditions must be satisfied (AND logic). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--detail_filter))
- `id` (String) The ID of the Environment to fetch.

### Read-Only

- `color` (String) The color of the Environment.
- `delete_protected` (Boolean) The current delete protection status of the Environment.
- `description` (String) The Environment's description.
- `name` (String) The name of the Environment.
- `slug` (String) The slug of the Environment.

### Nested Schema for `detail_filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the detail field to filter by. This must match a schema attribute of the resource (e.g., `name`, `description`, `id`).

Optional:

- `operator` (String) The comparison operator to use for filtering. Defaults to `equals`. Valid operators include:
  * `equals`, `=`, `eq` - Exact match comparison
  * `not-equals`, `!=`, `ne` - Inverse exact match comparison
  * `contains`, `in` - Substring inclusion check
  * `does-not-contain`, `not-in` - Inverse substring inclusion check
  * `starts-with` - Prefix matching
  * `does-not-start-with` - Inverse prefix matching
  * `ends-with` - Suffix matching
  * `does-not-end-with` - Inverse suffix matching
  * `>`, `gt` - Numeric greater than comparison
  * `>=`, `ge` - Numeric greater than or equal comparison
  * `<`, `lt` - Numeric less than comparison
  * `<=`, `le` - Numeric less than or equal comparison
  * `does-not-exist` - Field absence check
- `value` (String) The value of the detail field to match on. Required unless `value_regex` is set or `operator` is `does-not-exist`.
- `value_regex` (String) A regular expression string to apply to the value of the detail field to match on. Required unless `value` is set or `operator` is `does-not-exist`.
