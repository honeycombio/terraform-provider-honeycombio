# Data Source: honeycombio_column

The `honeycombio_column` data source retrieves the details of a single column in a dataset.

~> **Warning** Terraform will fail unless a column is returned by the search. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a column.
If you want to match multiple columns, use the `honeycombio_columns` data source instead.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

# Retrieve the details of a single column
data "honeycombio_column" "mycol" {
  dataset = var.dataset
  name    = "mycol"
}
```
