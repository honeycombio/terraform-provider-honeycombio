# Data Source: honeycombio_environments

The Environments data source retrieves the Team's environments.

-> This data source requires the provider be configured with a Management Key with `environments:read` in the configured scopes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# returns all Environments
data "honeycombio_environments" "all" {}

# only returns the Environments starting with 'foo_'
data "honeycombio_environments" "foo" {
  detail_filter {
    name        = "name"
    value_regex = "foo_*"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `detail_filter` (Block List) Attributes to filter the results with. Multiple `detail_filter` blocks can be provided, and all conditions must be satisfied (AND logic). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--detail_filter))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ids` (List of String) The list returned of Environments IDs.

<a id="nestedblock--detail_filter"></a>
### Nested Schema for `detail_filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the detail field to filter by. This must match a schema attribute of the resource (e.g., `name`, `description`, `id`).

Optional:

- `operator` (String) The comparison operator to use for filtering. Defaults to `equals`. Valid operators include:
  * `equals`, `=`, `eq` - Exact match comparison
  * `not-equals`, `!=`, `ne` - Inverse exact match comparison
  * `contains`, `in` - Substring inclusion check
  * `does-not-contain`, `not-in` - Inverse substring inclusion check
  * `starts-with` - Prefix matching
  * `does-not-start-with` - Inverse prefix matching
  * `ends-with` - Suffix matching
  * `does-not-end-with` - Inverse suffix matching
  * `>`, `gt` - Numeric greater than comparison
  * `>=`, `ge` - Numeric greater than or equal comparison
  * `<`, `lt` - Numeric less than comparison
  * `<=`, `le` - Numeric less than or equal comparison
  * `does-not-exist` - Field absence check
- `value` (String) The value of the detail field to match on. Required unless `value_regex` is set or `operator` is `does-not-exist`.
- `value_regex` (String) A regular expression string to apply to the value of the detail field to match on. Required unless `value` is set or `operator` is `does-not-exist`.

~> **Note** One of `value` or `value_regex` is required for each `detail_filter` block.
