# Data Source: honeycombio_derived_column

The `honeycombio_derived_column` data source retrieves the details of a single derived column.

~> **Warning** Terraform will fail unless a derived column is returned by the search. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a derived column.
If you want to match multiple derived columns, use the `honeycombio_derived_columns` data source instead.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "dataset" {
  type = string
}

# Retrieve the details of a single derived column
data "honeycombio_derived_column" "mydc" {
  dataset = var.dataset
  alias   = "mydc"
}
```
